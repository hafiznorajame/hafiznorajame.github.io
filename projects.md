Here is a collection of my personal project in statistics.

### Bayesian t-linear regression

**Abstract**: This short project aims to extend the usual normality assumption in the linear regression into Student's *t*-distribution errors. Bayesian inference is implemented and the choice of priors for the parameter degree of freedom is based on previous study.
**Key knowledge**: Bayesian statistics, Student's *t*-distributed errors, Rcpp
