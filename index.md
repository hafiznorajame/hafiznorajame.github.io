Hi, I am Hafiz! Recent MSc Statistics graduate at the University of Leeds, with a First-Class honours BSc Mathematics from Universiti Brunei Darussalam.

My main interest lies in the areas of statistical theory and computation, Bayesian statistics, mixed model, and biostatistics.

During my MSc, I did a dissertation project on the Joint Model of Multivariate Longitudinal Data and Survival Data, where I explored a model which have non-linear trajectories and extended the model by changing the assumption of multivariate normal errors into t-distributed errors.

As for my BSc, my final year project focused on statistical analysis of childhood cancer incidence in Brunei Darussalam, where I used the Joinpoint Regression to analyse the incidence trends.
